                                <p><strong>Stop-loss (Stop-Loss)</strong> is one of the key tools for
                                    <strong>risk management in
                                        trading</strong>. Proper configuration helps protect capital and avoid
                                    significant losses. This
                                    tool is especially important for both beginners and experienced traders as it helps
                                    prevent large losses
                                    in
                                    the event of unfavorable price movements.

                                <h2>What is a Stop-Loss and Why is it Important?</h2>
                                <p><strong>Stop-loss</strong> is an automatic order that closes a
                                    trader's position if the asset's price
                                    reaches a predetermined level. The primary goal of a stop-loss is to
                                    <strong>limit losses</strong> and
                                    protect capital from significant drawdowns.
                                </p>

                                <p>This tool is particularly important in trading because it allows you to:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Minimize losses</strong> – if the price moves against your
                                        position, the trade will close
                                        automatically.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Protect capital</strong> – prevents the deposit from being wiped out
                                        during sharp market
                                        movements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Discipline the trader</strong> – helps avoid emotional
                                        decisions and stick to the
                                        strategy.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Automate trading</strong> – you don't need to monitor the market
                                        24/7, the stop-loss will close
                                        the trade for you.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <div class="flex">
                                    <img class="pictureImg" src="/assets/img/content/stoploss1.png" loading="lazy"
                                        alt="What is a stop-loss and why is it important?">
                                </div>
                                <p>For example, if you bought <strong>BTC/USDT</strong> at a price of
                                    <strong>$40,000</strong> and set a
                                    stop-loss at
                                    <strong>$38,000</strong>, your position will automatically close if the price falls
                                    to this level,
                                    limiting
                                    your loss to <strong>$2,000</strong>. This protects you from larger losses in the
                                    event of continued
                                    market
                                    decline.
                                </p>

                                <p>Thus, a stop-loss is not just a tool but an essential part of a risk
                                    management system that helps
                                    traders preserve capital and improve the efficiency of their trading.</p>

                                <h2>How to Properly Set a Stop-Loss?</h2>
                                <p>There are several strategies for setting a stop-loss, each suitable for
                                    different types of trading and
                                    risk levels. The choice of method depends on your trading strategy, risk tolerance,
                                    and
                                    market volatility.</p>

                                <h3> Fixed Percentage of Capital</h3>
                                <p>This method assumes you predefine the percentage of your capital you are willing to
                                    risk in
                                    a single trade. Most traders use 1-2% of their deposit.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your deposit is $10,000 and you are willing to risk
                                    no more than 2%, your maximum
                                    loss on a single trade will be $200. You set the stop-loss at such a distance
                                    from the entry point that the
                                    potential loss does not exceed this value.</p>

                                <h3> Stop-Loss Based on Support and Resistance Levels</h3>
                                <p>This method relies on technical analysis. Traders place the stop-loss beyond
                                    key <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/levelofsupport">support or
                                        resistance</a> levels.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the asset is in an uptrend and the nearest support level
                                    is at $1,500, the stop-loss can be placed slightly below this level, for instance,
                                    at $1,480. If the price
                                    breaks
                                    through support, this
                                    could signal a trend reversal, and it is better to exit the trade.</p>

                                <h3> Stop-Loss Based on Volatility</h3>
                                <p>This method takes into account <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/volatility">market volatility</a> and
                                    helps avoid premature
                                    triggering of the stop-loss. Most often,
                                    the ATR (Average True
                                    Range) indicator is used for this purpose.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the ATR indicates that the average volatility of the
                                    asset
                                    is 50 points, the stop-loss
                                    can be set at a distance of 1.5–2 ATR from the entry point, allowing the position to
                                    avoid
                                    being prematurely closed due to market fluctuations.</p>
                                <div class="flex">
                                    <img class="pictureImg" src="/assets/img/content/stoploss2.png" loading="lazy"

                                <h3> Time-Based Stop-Loss</h3>
                                <p>This method is based on the idea that if the price does not reach the expected level
                                    within
                                    a certain period, it is better to close the trade.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you are trading using a strategy designed for 1 hour,
                                    and
                                    after this time the price is not
                                    moving in the desired direction, the trade can be closed manually.</p>

                                <p>Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, so it is important for
                                    traders to
                                    choose a stop-loss strategy based on their goals and market conditions.</p>

                                <h2>How to Calculate the Stop-Loss Size?</h2>
                                <p>To set a stop-loss correctly, it is important not only to choose a strategy but also
                                    to
                                    calculate its size accurately.
                                    Calculation errors can lead to either closing the trade too early or incurring
                                    excessive losses.</p>

                                <h3> Calculating Stop-Loss by Fixed Risk Percentage</h3>
                                <p>The formula for calculating stop-loss by fixed risk percentage:</p>
                                <p><strong>Stop-Loss Size = (Risk Percentage × Deposit) ÷ Position Size</strong></p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your deposit is $10,000 and you risk 2% per trade, then
                                    your maximum loss
                                    should be:</p>
                                <p><strong>0.02 × 10,000 = $200</strong></p>
                                <p>If you buy 100 shares, the stop-loss size in points will be:</p>
                                <p><strong>200 ÷ 100 = 2 points</strong></p>

                                <h3> Calculating Stop-Loss Using ATR</h3>
                                <p>The ATR indicator shows the average range of price movements over a specific period.
                                    To set an adequate
                                    stop-loss, you can use an ATR multiplier.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If the ATR on a daily chart shows 50 points, the stop-loss
                                    can be
                                    set at:</p>
                                <p><strong>50 × 1.5 = 75 points</strong></p>
                                <p>This accounts for the natural volatility of the asset and helps avoid premature
                                    stop-loss triggering.</p>

                                <h3> Calculating Stop-Loss Based on Support and Resistance Levels</h3>
                                <p>In this method, the stop-loss is set beyond the nearest support levels (for longs)
                                    or resistance levels (for
                                    shorts).</p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you buy BTC/USDT at $30,000 and the nearest support
                                    level
                                    is at $29,500,
                                    it makes sense to set the stop-loss slightly below – for instance, at $29,450.</p>

                                <h3> Calculating Stop-Loss Based on Risk/Reward</h3>
                                <p>Before entering a trade, it is worth determining the risk-to-reward ratio
                                    (Risk/Reward
                                    Ratio). The optimal value is no
                                    less than 1:2.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you expect the price to rise by 100 points and your
                                    risk is 50 points,
                                    the risk-to-reward ratio will be 1:2. This is considered a good trade.</p>

                                <p>Using these calculation methods will help you set a stop-loss correctly,

                                <h2>Main Mistakes When Setting a Stop-Loss</h2>
                                <p>Improper stop-loss placement can lead to frequent losses, even if your trading
                                    strategy is generally
                                    profitable. Let’s look at the most common mistakes traders make.
                                </p>

                                <h3> Too Narrow Stop-Loss</h3>
                                <p>If the stop-loss is set too close to the entry point, even a minor market
                                    movement can close your
                                    position at a loss.</p>
                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> You bought BTC/USDT at $40,000 and set the stop-loss at
                                    $39,900. If the price slightly
                                    corrects, the trade will close, but then the price may continue to rise.</p>

                                <h3> Too Wide Stop-Loss</h3>
                                <p>If the stop-loss is set too far, you could lose a significant portion of your
                                    capital in case of an unsuccessful
                                    move.</p>
                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you enter a trade with a $1,000 deposit and set the
                                    stop-loss at 50% of
                                    your capital, one failed trade could cost you half of your account.</p>

                                </div>
                                <h3> Setting a Stop-Loss at Obvious Levels</h3>
                                <p>Many traders place stop-losses directly at round levels ($30,000, $40,000, etc.),
                                    where a large number of
                                    orders are concentrated. This makes them vulnerable to manipulation.</p>
                                <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Place the stop-loss slightly below or above the key
                                    level (e.g., not $30,000 but $29,950).</p>

                                <h3> Ignoring Volatility</h3>
                                <p>If you don’t take market volatility into account, your stop-loss may be triggered
                                    too frequently.
                                    Use the ATR indicator to help determine a
                                    reasonable range for price movement.</p>

                                <h3> Moving the Stop-Loss to a Losing Position</h3>
                                <p>Sometimes traders move their stop-loss further away, hoping the price will reverse.
                                    This
                                    is a dangerous practice that can lead to significant losses.</p>
                                <p><strong>How to avoid:</strong> Set your stop-loss at a justified level and do not
                                    change it without a clear reason.
                                </p>

                                <h3> Not Using a Stop-Loss</h3>
                                <p>Some traders prefer not to set a stop-loss, hoping to close the trade manually.
                                    This can lead to
                                    significant losses, especially during sharp market movements.</p>

                                <h2>How to Choose the Optimal Stop-Loss for Different Strategies?</h2>
                                <p>Each trading strategy requires an individual approach to setting a stop-loss.
                                    Let’s explore which methods are best
                                    suited for scalping, intraday trading, and long-term investing.</p>

                                <h3> Stop-Loss for Scalping</h3>
                                <p><a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/scalpingintrading">Scalping</a> is a
                                    strategy where traders execute many
                                    trades throughout
                                    the day, aiming to profit from
                                    small price fluctuations. Here, minimizing losses is crucial, as frequent trades
                                    increase risks.</p>

                                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stop-loss size: 0.2-0.5% of the asset’s price.</li>
                                    <li>Use technical indicators (e.g., Bollinger
                                        Bands or ATR).</li>
                                    <li>Place the stop-loss beyond the nearest support or resistance levels.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Stop-Loss for Intraday Trading</h3>
                                <p>Day trading requires a more flexible approach to stop-loss, as there can be sharp
                                    movements within the day.</p>

                                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stop-loss size: 0.5-1.5% of the price.</li>
                                    <li>Use support and resistance levels on higher timeframes (H1, H4).</li>
                                    <li>Apply trailing stop to protect profits.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Stop-Loss for Medium-Term Trading</h3>
                                <p>Medium-term traders (holding trades from several days to weeks) set wider stop-losses
                                    to avoid being stopped out due to market noise.</p>

                                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stop-loss size: 2-5% of the price.</li>
                                    <li>Use fundamental analysis and important news.</li>
                                    <li>Place the stop-loss below key support levels.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Stop-Loss for Long-Term Investing</h3>
                                <p>Investors rarely use stop-losses, but during periods of high volatility, they can be
                                    helpful.</p>

                                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stop-loss size: 10-20% of the price.</li>
                                    <li>Use fundamental analysis and consider macroeconomic factors.</li>
                                    <li>Set the stop-loss below long-term support levels.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The choice of stop-loss depends on your trading strategy.
                                    The shorter the trade duration,
                                    the smaller the stop-loss should be. Use methods that match
                                    your trading style and risk level.</p>

                                <h2>How to Adapt a Stop-Loss to Market Conditions?</h2>
                                <p>The market does not always behave the same way: there are periods of high volatility,
                                    sideways
                                    movements, and trending phases.
                                    Successful traders adapt their stop-losses according to market conditions
                                    to minimize losses and
                                    protect profits.</p>

                                <h3> Setting a Stop-Loss in a Trending Market</h3>
                                <p>When the market is moving in one direction (bullish or bearish trend), the stop-loss
                                    should
                                    follow the price but not
                                    be too close to avoid premature stop-outs.</p>

                                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Use a trailing stop to lock in profits.</li>
                                    <li>Place the stop-loss behind the most recent local low (for long positions) or
                                        high (for short positions).</li>
                                    <li>Refer to <a class="linkrefinto"

                                            averages</a> (e.g., 50-day or 200-day) to determine
                                        dynamic stop-loss levels.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Stop-Loss in a Sideways Market</h3>
                                <p>During sideways market movement (range), the price fluctuates within a narrow range,
                                    so
                                    it is important to avoid false
                                    stop-outs.</p>

                                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Place the stop-loss outside the range boundaries.</li>
                                    <li>Consider support and resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li>Use a smaller stop-loss size since price movements are usually limited.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Stop-Loss During High Volatility</h3>
                                <p>During news events or sharp market movements, the price can change rapidly,
                                    increasing the
                                    likelihood of stop-loss
                                    activation.</p>

                                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Widen the stop-loss during periods of high volatility to avoid premature
                                        stop-outs.</li>
                                    <li>Use the ATR indicator to adapt
                                        the stop-loss to market conditions.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid opening trades during major news releases if you are uncertain about price
                                        direction.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Adapting the stop-loss to market conditions helps
                                    reduce the likelihood of random
                                    stop-outs and improves capital protection. Avoid using fixed stop-loss levels
                                    without
                                    considering current market

                                <h2>How to Combine Stop-Loss with Other Risk Management Tools?</h2>
                                <p>Setting a stop-loss is not enough for successful trading. It is important to combine
                                    it with
                                    other <a class="linkrefinto"

                                        management tools</a> to
                                    minimize losses and improve trade efficiency.</p>

                                <h3> Risk/Reward Ratio</h3>
                                <p>Before entering a trade, you must determine the risk-to-reward ratio. The optimal
                                    ratio is no less than
                                    <strong>1:2</strong>, meaning the potential profit should be twice as much as the
                                    possible loss.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you set a stop-loss at 50 points, the take-profit should
                                    be at least 100
                                    points.</p>

                                <h3> Capital Diversification</h3>
                                <p>Do not invest all your capital in one trade. It is better to spread risks across
                                    different assets and strategies.</p>

                                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Do not risk more than <strong>2% of your deposit</strong> on a single trade.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Use multiple assets to reduce dependency on a single position.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Risk Hedging</h3>
                                <p>Hedging involves opening opposite trades on other assets to reduce
                                    overall risk.</p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you have a long position on BTC, you can open a short
                                    position on altcoins that
                                    correlate with it.</p>

                                <h3> Limiting Daily Losses</h3>
                                <p>If you lose a certain percentage of your deposit during the day, it is better to stop
                                    and
                                    analyze mistakes rather than
                                    trying to "recover."</p>

                                <p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Limit daily losses to 3-5% of your deposit.</li>
                                    <li>Set a <strong>maximum number of trades per day</strong> to avoid overtrading.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Combining Stop-Loss with Take-Profit</h3>
                                <p>Take-profit is an order that closes a trade when a certain profit level is reached.
                                    Always
                                    set a take-profit to lock in profits and avoid leaving a trade open for too long.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your strategy has a 1:3 risk/reward ratio, with a
                                    stop-loss of 50 points,
                                    the take-profit should be 150 points.</p>

                                <p>Combining stop-loss with other risk management tools
                                    reduces the likelihood of significant losses and improves trading results. Do not
                                    limit yourself
                                    to just one method of capital protection.</p>

                                <h2>How to Analyze Stop-Loss Triggers and Improve Your Strategy?</h2>
                                <p>Even with a well-set stop-loss, there are situations where it triggers too
                                    frequently or too early.
                                    Analyzing the reasons can help adjust your strategy and avoid unnecessary losses.
                                </p>

                                <h3> Keeping a Trading Journal</h3>
                                <p>One of the best ways to improve your strategy is to log all your trades in a journal.
                                    This
                                    will help identify recurring
                                    mistakes.</p>

                                <p><strong>What to record:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Entry and exit points for the trade.</li>
                                    <li>Stop-loss and take-profit levels.</li>
                                    <li>The reason for entering the position.</li>
                                    <li>Trade outcome (profit/loss).</li>
                                    <li>Market conditions (news, volatility, trends).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Analyzing Stop-Loss Frequency</h3>
                                <p>If your stop-loss triggers too often, it may be a signal that adjustments are needed.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Reasons for frequent stop-loss triggers:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Stop-loss is too tight (not accounting for volatility).</li>
                                    <li>Stop-loss is placed at obvious levels (the market often "cleans out" such
                                        levels).</li>
                                    <li>Trading against the trend (poor analysis of market movements).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <div class="flex">

                                <h3> Optimizing the Stop-Loss</h3>
                                <p>After analyzing the data, adjustments can be made to the stop-loss setup:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Use ATR (Average True Range) to calculate the optimal stop-loss.</li>
                                    <li>Review your entry strategy (avoid entering trades near levels with high
                                        volatility).</li>
                                    <li>Test different stop-loss distances on a demo account.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3> Using Alternative Protection Methods</h3>
                                <p>Sometimes it is worth considering not only a classic stop-loss but also other ways to
                                    minimize risks:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Hedging (opening opposite positions).</li>
                                    <li>Partial exit from a trade (locking in profits incrementally).</li>
                                    <li>Using options to protect against large losses.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Regular analysis of stop-loss triggers and
                                    strategy adjustments can help reduce
                                    losses and improve trading efficiency. Use a trading journal, test different
                                    methods, and
                                    adapt
                                    your strategy to current market conditions.</p>

                                <h2>Conclusion: How to Use Stop-Loss Correctly?</h2>
                                <p>Stop-loss is one of the most important tools in a trader's arsenal. Proper
                                    configuration allows you
                                    to minimize losses, protect capital, and improve trading efficiency. However,
                                    many traders make
                                    mistakes related to improper stop-loss settings, leading to frequent stop-outs and
                                    unjustified
                                    losses.</p>

                                <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Choose a stop-loss strategy based on your trading style
                                        (scalping, day trading,
                                        medium-term trades, investing).</li>
                                    <li>Calculate your stop-loss based on risk/reward, support and
                                        resistance levels, volatility (ATR), and
                                        market conditions.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid setting stop-loss too close to the entry point to reduce the chance of
                                        random
                                        stop-outs.</li>
                                    <li>Analyze the market before setting a stop-loss: trend, news background,
                                        liquidity.</li>
                                    <li>Use trailing stop-losses to protect profits in trending movements.</li>
                                    <li>Maintain a trading journal to analyze stop-loss triggers and
                                        adjust your strategy.</li>
                                    <li>Combine stop-loss with other risk management tools, such as
                                        diversification, limiting
                                        daily losses, and hedging.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Remember, stop-loss is not a guarantee against losses but a tool to minimize them.
                                    The
                                    key to successful
                                    trading is discipline, analysis, and continuous improvement of your strategy.
                                    Study the market, test
                                    new methods, and your trading will become more stable and profitable.</p>
