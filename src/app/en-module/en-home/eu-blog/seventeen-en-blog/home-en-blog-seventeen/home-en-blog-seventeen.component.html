                                    These myths are often based on misunderstandings, unrealistic expectations, and a

                                    and easily. The reality is that successful trading requires time, effort, and
                                    consistency.</p>

                                <h3>Why is this a myth?</h3>

                                <p>Many believe that significant capital is necessary to start trading. While large
                                    investments can
                                    increase profit potential, they are not required to get started.</p>

                                <h3>Why is this a myth?</h3>
                                <p>Modern brokers and trading platforms allow you to start with small amounts. For
                                    instance, many

                                <p>There is a misconception that professional traders almost never experience losses. In
                                    reality, even the most
                                    experienced traders make mistakes.</p>

                                <h3>Why is this a myth?</h3>
                                <p>Trading is a game of probabilities. Successful traders understand that losses are
                                    part of the process. The key is
                                    to minimize losses and achieve overall profitability over the long term.</p>

                                <p>Don't be afraid of mistakes. It is important to analyze your trades, learn from your

                                    this is not always the case.</p>

                                    decisions. Simple strategies based

                                <p>There is a belief that traders need to sit in front of their screens all day and
                                    track every price movement.
                                    However, this is not always necessary.</p>

                                <p>While day traders may spend a lot of time monitoring the market, many strategies,
                                    such as swing trading or
                                    holding, require much less time. You can use stop-loss and take-profit orders to
                                    automate the process.</p>

                                <h3>Tip:</h3>

                                    possible. This approach often

                                <p>While large institutional investors can influence the market, no one can fully
                                    control it. The market is subject
                                    to numerous factors, including economic events, news, and the actions of millions of

                                <p>Do not try to predict the actions of large players. Focus on your own analysis and
                                    strategy.</p>
