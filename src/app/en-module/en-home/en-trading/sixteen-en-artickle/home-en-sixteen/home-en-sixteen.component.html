                                    </strong> project was proposed by <strong>Vitalik Buterin</strong> in 2013
                                    as a solution for creating a programmable blockchain capable of executing complex
                                    computations.
                                    Unlike Bitcoin, which is designed for value transfer,
                                    Ethereum enables the creation of <strong>decentralized applications (DApps)</strong>
                                    and <strong>smart contracts</strong>.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    One of the main features of <strong>Ethereum</strong> is its support for
                                    <strong>smart contracts</strong> —
                                    self-executing programs that operate when predefined conditions are met.
                                    Smart contracts replace traditional legal agreements, eliminating the need for
                                    intermediaries.
                                </p>
                                <h3>How Do Smart Contracts Work?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    A smart contract is written in the <strong>Solidity</strong> programming language
                                    and runs inside
                                    the <strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</strong>.
                                    Once deployed on the network, its code becomes immutable, and the execution
                                    conditions are predefined.
                                    For example, a smart contract can automatically transfer funds if both parties
                                    fulfill their agreements.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Examples of Smart Contract Use:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>DeFi Platforms</strong> – automated lending and trading without banks.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>NFT Marketplaces</strong> – creation and sale of digital assets.</li>
                                    <li><strong>DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)</strong> – project
                                        governance through voting.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gaming Applications</strong> – in-game assets operating on the
                                        blockchain.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Stablecoins</strong> – issuance of digital currencies pegged to fiat
                                        assets.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Ethereum 2.0 and the Transition to Proof-of-Stake</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Initially, Ethereum operated on the <strong>Proof-of-Work (PoW)</strong> algorithm,
                                    similar to Bitcoin.
                                    However, high network congestion and transaction fees led to the need for an
                                    upgrade.
                                    In 2022, Ethereum officially transitioned to <strong>Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</strong>
                                    as part of
                                    the <strong>The Merge</strong> upgrade.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Key Changes in Ethereum 2.0:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Elimination of Mining</strong> – miners no longer generate ETH; the
                                        network is secured by
                                        validators.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reduced Energy Consumption</strong> – switching to PoS reduced
                                        Ethereum’s energy usage by
                                        <strong>99.9%</strong>.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Improved Scalability</strong> – new mechanisms, including sharding, will
                                        increase transaction
                                        throughput.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lower Fees</strong> – thanks to updates, transaction costs are expected
                                        to decrease.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>How Does Proof-of-Stake Work?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In the new system, instead of miners, the network is maintained by
                                    <strong>validators</strong>,
                                    who lock (stake) a certain amount of ETH (a minimum of <strong>32 ETH</strong>) to
                                    validate transactions.
                                    The more ETH staked, the higher the chances of earning rewards.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Advantages of PoS Over PoW:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Energy efficiency and a more environmentally friendly approach.</li>
                                    <li>Less centralization – more users can participate in securing the network.</li>
                                    <li>Enhanced security through economic incentives.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Ethereum’s transition to PoS has made it one of the most eco-friendly blockchain
                                    platforms
                                    and has opened up opportunities for further network scalability.

                                    DeFi applications run on <strong>smart contracts</strong>, which automatically
                                    execute financial operations
                                    without requiring trust between users.
                                    For example, on a DeFi platform, users can take out a loan by collateralizing
                                    cryptocurrency
                                    without needing approval from a bank.

                                <p>
                                    Ethereum was the first blockchain platform to support <strong>non-fungible tokens
                                        (NFTs)</strong>.
                                    NFTs are unique digital assets that verify ownership of images, music,
                                    in-game items, and other digital objects.
                                    Unlike regular tokens, NFTs <strong>cannot be divided and have a unique
                                        identifier</strong>.
                                </p>
                                <h3>How Do NFTs Work?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    NFTs are created using <strong>Ethereum standards ERC-721 and ERC-1155</strong>.
                                    Each token contains <strong>metadata</strong>, including the owner's name,
                                    description, and a link to the
                                    digital asset.
                                    NFTs can be bought, sold, and stored on compatible platforms.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Popular NFT Marketplaces on Ethereum:</h3>

                                    <li><strong>Music</strong> – musicians release albums and earn royalties without
                                        record labels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Real Estate</strong> – NFTs can represent ownership rights for virtual
                                        and real-world properties.
                                    </li>

                                        contracts</strong>
                                    and <strong>decentralized applications (DApps)</strong>,
                                    making it the leading blockchain development platform.

                                <h3>2. Can Ethereum Be Mined?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Before 2022, Ethereum used the <strong>Proof-of-Work (PoW)</strong> consensus
                                    mechanism,
                                    allowing mining. However, after the <strong>The Merge</strong> upgrade,
                                    Ethereum transitioned to <strong>Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</strong>,
                                    and mining was completely disabled.
                                    Now, users can participate in staking by locking up
                                    <strong>a minimum of 32 ETH</strong> to support the network and earn rewards.

                                <p>
                                    Ethereum is one of the most secure blockchain networks,
                                    as its nodes are distributed worldwide.
                                    However, within Ethereum's ecosystem, smart contracts can have vulnerabilities
                                    if they are poorly coded.
                                    Therefore, it is essential to analyze the security and code of DeFi applications
                                    before using them.
                                </p>
