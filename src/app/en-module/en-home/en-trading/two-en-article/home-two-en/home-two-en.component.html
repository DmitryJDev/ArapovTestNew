                                    </li>

                                <h3>What is Liquidity?</h3>
                                <p>Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold without causing
                                    significant price changes.
                                    Highly liquid assets, such as major currency pairs (EUR/USD, USD/JPY) and stocks of
                                    large companies
                                    (Apple, Microsoft), have tight spreads and high trading volumes. Low-liquidity
                                    assets, such as small-cap stocks
                                    or exotic currency pairs, have wider spreads and higher volatility.</p>

                                <h3>What is Volatility?</h3>
                                <p>Volatility measures how much an asset's price fluctuates over a given period. It is
                                    expressed in percentages
                                    and can be high (Bitcoin, oil) or low (bonds, gold). High volatility creates
                                    opportunities for traders
                                    but also increases risks.</p>

                                <h3>Additional Terms</h3>
                                <p>The financial market includes many concepts that help traders better understand

                                    <li><strong>Margin Trading:</strong> Using borrowed funds (leverage) to increase
                                        trade sizes.</li>

                                        reports to predict price
                                        movements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Technical Analysis:</strong> Using charts, indicators, and patterns to

                                        which indicate potential trend reversals.</li>

                                        trading behavior.</li>

                                    strategies,

                                <h2>Key Terms of Technical and Fundamental Analysis</h2>
                                <p>Traders and investors use two key methods for predicting price movements:
                                    <strong>technical analysis</strong> (TA) and <strong>fundamental analysis</strong>
                                    (FA).
                                    Both approaches are essential parts of trading and help make more informed decisions
                                    in the market.
                                </p>

                                    forecasting future price movements based on historical data. It is built on three
                                    key principles:</p>

                                    <li><strong>Price movements follow trends:</strong> Asset prices do not change
                                        chaotically
                                        but follow certain trends (uptrend, downtrend, or sideways movement).</li>
                                    <li><strong>History repeats itself:</strong> Market behavior patterns recur
                                        due to human psychology.</li>
                                </ul>
